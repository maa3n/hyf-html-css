  <h1>Dinosaur Story</h1>

<div id="mainbody">
  
  <p class="top">Dinosaurs roamed the Earth over <strong>200 million</strong> years ago and were the dominant terrestrial vertebrate for <strong>135 million</strong> years.
    <br> It is believed their extinction came about because of changes in the climate they couldn’t adapt to.
    <br> Birds are the closest relative to a dinosaur that we have.  <br> Below are some interesting facts about dinosaurs.. </p>
  
  <ul class="top2">
     <li>Dinosaurs walked the earth for over <em>165 million</em> years.  </li>
    <li>They lived during a period of time known as the Mesozoic Era, or Age of reptiles. </li>
     <li>At the end of the Cretaceous Period they became extinct that was around 65 million years ago. 
       <br> During this time there was a great deal of volcanic activity and many earthquakes.  </li>
     <li> Many people believe that dinosaurs became extinct because an asteroid hit the earth changing the climate dramatically. 
       <br> It is believed that dinosaurs couldn’t adapt to these changes. </li>
    <li> The word dinosaur means <strong>terrifying lizard</strong>. 
      <br> This name was invented by Sir Richard Owen in 1842. </li>
    <li> The oldest known dinosaur is <strong>Eoraptor</strong>, a meat eater that lived 228 million years ago.  </li>
     <li> Most dinosaurs hatch from eggs, and they could not fly or live in water. </li>
     <li> Dinosaurs are classified as reptiles. They are divided into two groups based on the structure of the hip.
       <br> One group has lizard like hips and the other group has bird-like hips. </li>
     <li>Most palaeontologists, scientists that study dinosaurs, believe that birds are the only surviving dinosaurs.
       <br> So dinosaurs aren’t really extinct because their descendants are still living. </li>
     <li>The biggest dinosaurs were over 100 feet long and 50 feet tall… the sauropod was the largest dinosaur… 
       <br> the smallest dinosaurs were the size of a chicken and were called mussaurus, or mouse lizard. </li>
     <li> Some dinosaurs were carnivores, meat-eaters, and some were herbivores, plant eaters. 
       <br> Some walked on two legs, while others walked on all four legs. Some had horns and spikes,
       <br> others had thick bumpy skin, and some even had feathers. </li>
     <li>The color of all dinosaurs is unknown because no one was alive at that time in history. </li>
     <li> There are currently over 330 described dinosaur species and this number is growing. </li>

    The Tyrannosaurus had a life span of around 30 years. The dinosaur has many similar features to birds, one thought is that they were warm blooded like birds, rather than cold blooded like reptiles.
    <br> And there arms were too short to reach its mouth. 
     It could probably eat as much as 500 pounds of meat in a single bite.
 <br>Their babies may have been covered in feathers.

     Apatosaurus was gigantic. It was about 90 feet long, about 15 feet tall at the hips and weighed approximately 38 tons. 
    <br> Thankfully, this animal was a herbivore, which means that it diet consisted of mainly leaves and other plant material. 
    <br>It had chisel like teeth that could quickly remove the leaves from branches, but it didn’t chew up the plant material with its teeth. No, scientists now believe that these animals swallowed stones to help them grind up plant material in their stomachs.
    <br> Rocks used in this way are called gizzard stones or gastrolithes.

    Probably the most well known flying dinosaur, the Pterodactyl is not actually a dinosaur at all,
    <br> but a pterosaur! Pterosaurs were airborne reptiles of the Late Jurassic period,
    <br>and they are frequently associated with dinosaurs in the popular imagination.
    <br>It soared through the pre-historic skies of what is now Europe and northern Africa.

    Cryptoclidus belonged to the group of Plesiosaurus. They belonged to the clan of different reptiles who included marine reptiles and ichthyosaurs. 
     They were believed to have descended from land living creatures who have by the way of evolution returned to the sea.
    However still now there has been divided opinion on the relation of Plesiosaurs with other marine group of animals. Still now there has been enough scientific evidence that Plesiosaurs were distantly related to other groups of dinosaurs.
    <br> There have been different theories regarding the habitat of Cryptoclidus not being completely marine by nature.
    <br> There have been different schools of thought who are of the opinion that Cryptoclidus spent a considerable part of their day in land. 
They must have visited the sea when they needed to feed. Again practically it is impossible to prove how Cryptoclidus divided their entire day between land and water. 
    <br> Anatomical details however prove that land movement was possible for these animals to avail movement on the land however they must have been a much graceful creature within water.

    Triceratops is certainly one of the most recognizable dinosaurs of all time. 
    <br> Active during the late Cretaceious, its name derives from its three distinct horns on its head, 
    <br>just below an armored crest that protects its neck and shoulders.
    <br> It plods around on all fours, and was an herbivore. 
    <br> It probably used its formidable arsenal for defense rather than hunting live prey.
